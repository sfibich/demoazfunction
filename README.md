# funWithTerraform
Scripts I've put together to help me learn terraform as well as other Azure technologies.  The setup .sh scripts are geared to work for a Linux platform

## Befor running Terraform load environment variables
1. Log into Azure using az account login 
2. Run "source ./LoadAzureTerraformSecretsToEnvVars.sh" to set up the shell variables
