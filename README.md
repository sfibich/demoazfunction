# funWithTerraform
scripts put together to help me learn terraform as well as other Azure technologies

Before Running Terraform
Run the LoadAzureTerraformSecretsToEnvVars.ps1 passing it your Key Vault Name
Run the setSubscriptionId.ps1 with the subscripton you would like to deploy to (if you have more than one) 



If this is the first time running Terraform
terraform init
terraform new workspace WORKSPACENAME
